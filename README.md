# Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-For-Anomaly-detection-in-IoT-Devices
College Major Project
We have analyzed several machine learning algorithms by doing fine tuning on the dataset of IoT smart devices, that is first cleaned and pre-processed so that can be used to train the algorithms. We have measured the accuracy of all the algorithms by using different methods and find the best suitable model of this kind of data.
